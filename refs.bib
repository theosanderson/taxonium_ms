	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are an important tool for interpreting sequenced genomes, and their interrelationships. Estimating the date associated with each node of such a phylogeny creates a {\textquotedblleft}time tree{\textquotedblright}, which can be especially useful for visualising and analysing evolution of organisms such as viruses. Several tools have been developed for time-tree estimation, but the sequencing explosion in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created phylogenies so large as to prevent the application of these previous approaches to full datasets. Here we introduce Chronumental, a tool that can rapidly infer time trees from phylogenies featuring large numbers of nodes. Chronumental uses stochastic gradient descent to identify lengths of time for tree branches which maximise the evidence lower bound under a probabilistic model, implemented in a framework which can be compiled into XLA for rapid computation. We show that Chronumental scales to phylogenies featuring millions of nodes, with chronological predictions made in minutes, and is able to accurately predict the dates of nodes for which it is not provided with metadata.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {To combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, scientists have been conducting research at breakneck speeds, producing over 52,000 peer reviewed articles within the first 12 months. In contrast, a little over 1,000 peer reviewed articles were published within the first 12 months of the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic starting in 2002. In addition to publications, there has also been an upsurge in clinical trials to develop vaccines and treatments, scientific protocols to study SARS-CoV-2, methodology for epidemiological modeling, and datasets spanning molecular studies to social science research. One of the largest challenges has been keeping track of the vast amounts of newly generated disparate data and research that exist in independent repositories. To address this issue, we developed outbreak.info, which provides a standardized, searchable interface of heterogeneous data resources on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. Unifying metadata from 14 data repositories, we have assembled a collection of over 200,000 publications, clinical trials, datasets, protocols, and other resources as of October 2021. We used a rigorous schema to enforce a consistent format across different data sources and resource types, and linked related resources where possible. This enables users to quickly retrieve information across data repositories, regardless of resource type or repository location. Outbreak.info also combines the combined research library with spatiotemporal genomics data on SARS-CoV-2 variants and epidemiological data on COVID-19 cases and deaths. The web interface provides interactive visualizations and reports to explore the unified data and generate hypotheses. In addition to providing a web interface, we also publish the data we have assembled and standardized in a high performance public API and an R package. Finally, we discuss the challenges inherent in combining metadata from scattered and heterogeneous resources and provide recommendations to streamline this process to aid scientific research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetics has been foundational to SARS-CoV-2 research and public health policy, assisting in genomic surveillance, contact tracing, and assessing emergence and spread of new variants. However, phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have often relied on tools designed for de novo phylogenetic inference, in which all data are collected before any analysis is performed and the phylogeny is inferred once from scratch. SARS-CoV-2 datasets do not fit this mould. There are currently over 510 million sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes in publiconline databases, with tens of thousands of new genomes added every day. Continuous data collection, combined with the public health relevance of SARS-CoV-2, invites an "online" approach to phylogenetics, in which new samples are added to existing phylogenetic trees every day. The extremely dense sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes also invites a comparison between Likelihoodlikelihood and Parsimonyparsimony approaches to phylogenetic inference. Maximum Likelihoodlikelihood (ML) methods are more accurate when there are multiple changes at a single site on a single branch, but this accuracy comes at a large computational cost, and the dense sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes means that these instances will be extremely rare. because each internal branch is expected to be extremely short. Therefore, it may be that approaches based on Maximum Parsimonymaximum parsimony (MP) are sufficiently accurate for reconstructing phylogenies of SARS-CoV-2, and their simplicity means that they can be applied to much larger datasets. Here, we evaluate the performance of de novo and online phylogenetic approaches, and ML and MP frameworks, for inferring large and dense SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies. Overall, we find that online phylogenetics produces similar phylogenetic trees to de novo analyses for SARS-CoV-2, and that MP optimizations produce more accurate SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies than do ML optimizations. Since MP is thousands of times faster than presently available implementations of ML and online phylogenetics is faster than de novo, we therefore propose that, in the context of comprehensive genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, MP online phylogenetics approaches should be favored.Competing Interest StatementRobert Lanfear works as an advisor to GISAID.
