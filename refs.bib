	title = {Genome data from sweet and grain sorghum ({Sorghum} bicolor)},
	url = {http://gigadb.org/dataset/100012},
	abstract = {Sorghum is produced globally as a source of food, feed, fiber, and fuel.  Grain and sweet sorghums differ in a number of important traits including stem sugar and juice accumulation, plant height, and the production of grain and biomass.  The first sorghum whole-genome sequences are now available for analysis, but additional genomic sequences will be required to study genome-wide and intraspecific variation for dissecting the genetic basis of these important traits and for tailor-designed breeding of this important C4 crop.

In a joint effort with scientists from the Institute of Botany of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing) and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (Singapore), BGI resequenced two sweet and one grain sorghum inbred lines: E-Tian, Ji2731, and Keller.  E-Tian (literally meaning Russian Sweet in Chinese) is a sweet sorghum line introduced into China in the early 1970{\textquoteright}s. Ji2731 is a Chinese kaoliang grain sorghum that is well adapted to Northeast China.  Keller is an American-bred elite sweet sorghum line shown to perform well across a wide range of environmental conditions.

Using the re-sequencing data, a set of nearly 1,500 genes differentiating sweet and grain sorghum were identified.  These genes fall into 10 major metabolic pathways involved in sugar and starch metabolisms, lignin and coumarin biosynthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, stress responses and DNA damage repair.  In addition, 1,057,018 SNPs, 99,948 indels of 1-10bp in length and 16,487 presence/absence variations were uncovered, and 17,111 CNVs were detected.  The majority of the SNPs, large-effect SNPs, indels and presence/absence variations resided in genes containing leucine rich repeats, PPR repeats and disease resistance R genes possessing diverse biological functions or under diversifying selection, but were absent in genes which are essential for life.

This is the first publically available data that allows the identification of genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in sorghum.  The high-density SNP and indel markers presented here will be a valuable resource for future genotype and phenotype studies and the molecular breeding of this important crop and for related species.},

	abstract = {The mitotic spindle functions to move chromosomes to alignment at metaphase, then segregate sister chromatids during anaphase. Analysis of spindle microtubule kinetics utilizing fluorescence dissipation after photoactivation described two main populations, a slow and a fast turnover population, historically taken to reflect kinetochore versus non-kinetochore microtubules respectively. This two component demarcation seems likely oversimplified. Microtubule turnover may vary among different spindle microtubules, regulated by spatial distribution and interactions with other microtubules and with organelles such as kinetochores, chromosome arms, and the cell cortex. How turnover among various spindle microtubules is differentially regulated and its significance remains unclear. We tested the concept of kinetochore versus non-kinetochore microtubules by disrupting kinetochores through depletion of the Ndc80 complex. In the absence of functional kinetochores, microtubule dynamics still exhibited slow and fast turnover populations, though proportions and timings of turnover were altered. Importantly, the data obtained following Hec1/Ndc80 depletion suggests other sub-populations, in addition to kinetochore microtubules, contribute to the slow turnover population. Further manipulation of spindle microtubules revealed a complex landscape. Dissection of the dynamics of microtubule populations will provide a greater understanding of mitotic spindle kinetics and insight into roles in facilitating chromosome attachment, movement, and segregation during mitosis.},
